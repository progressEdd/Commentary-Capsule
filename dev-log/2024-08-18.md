## Overall Progress
1. Create github repo and project name
2. Create developer environment (using setup from dev-onboarding)
3. Find review source

## Find review source
- LTT Store's customer reviews are handled by judge.me, previously the reviews would be embedded on the product page
- Let's start with the backpack's reviews [direct link](https://judge.me/reviews/linus-tech-tips-store.myshopify.com/products/backpack) in a notebook
- I got a error ` could not initialize webview error could not register service worker`
  - This stackoverflow solution resolved it ["Error loading webview: Error: Could not register service workers: TypeError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker for scope"](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69316961)
- launching the playwright browser and loading the page
