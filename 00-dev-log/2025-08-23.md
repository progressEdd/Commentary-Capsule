## Overall Progress
- [x] Reorganized the repo to project template
- [x] Explored the classifications and cleaned up the sentiment
- [x] Started looking into making a dashboard

## Explored Classifications
- The llm had over 100 classes, so I had chatgpt reduce and bin it down to 20
- Sentiment seemed to be also a variety, didn't seem to be propoerly classed. I think the pydantic model needs refinement, but we can work with it and have chatgpt write code to convert the scores out of 100 and 5 into normalized versions

## Dashboard Exploration
- Goal: Wrap the classifications up into a dashboard to make it more approachable. 
- Progress: got bun setup and went through the wizard. Debating on using Svelte or React. Friends recommend Svelte, but chatgpt and claude seem to be better adapted for React. Will have to explore further
