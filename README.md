# Commentary-Capsule
## Background
Welcome to this project. I started it to not only showcase my experiences in local open source LLM development, but also give a path for others to do similar work.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Build the python environment with poetry. If you are unfamiliar with poetry, feel free to refer to this onboarding guide I wrote [python-virtual-environments](https://github.com/progressEdd/dev-onboarding/blob/master/python-environments/python-virtual-environments.md)
