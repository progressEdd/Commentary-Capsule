And that leaves the bigger main compartment completely free to fill with whatever else you might need.

The latter is an easy one for me, never had a backpack fail there, so not a concern if it's thiccer or 2 layers. The bigger one are the Zippers, where I have the issue that one of sleds got loose enough to get the tab out. (picture 1) When I contacted support (about one year ago) I got the update that the new one will come soon (TM) and now a year later I hear they've been able to ship 500. Seriously guys, 500 in about 10 months (start of production UPDATE 7/05/2023 and actually sending out stuff UPDATE 2/27/2024)? I've been in the 3rd wave, if I extrapolat this I'll have a new backpack before you send mine. At least I now know where I'll get the update. The second thing I noticed about my zipper is that it has a few teeth that start to fail in the tech pouch (picture 2)\n<br />What I personally finding a bit iffy is that they focus on giving us Store Credit. (yes the zippers were partially refunded, but if I remember correctly that was even before I got my pack. Been a while) Dont' get me wrong, Store Credit can be a good thing if you are regularly buying off the site. I use one where it's my preference then get it back on my card. But I do not use LTT Store much, since it's a Canadian site. And the shipping/taxes/fees (more on that later) are rather steep for what I can get locally. So I had the choice of sending the pack back, or just accept the loss, especially since the credit is not granted infinetly. Either isn't ideal.</p>\n\n<p>But there has been some good things, for which I do like the pack. Then one of the big selling points is the amount of space for Tech. I dalydrive a Legion Notebook, and for that the space is perfect. That's what I really love about it, I can fit a chonky 16'' in the back withough fiddeling like I had to in my Backpack. Add to that the rest that I need (Powercable, paper wallet, calculater, daly meal, ...) (picture 3) and I do have a pretty full pack every day. The LTT Backpack really did make that all better destributed, and I'm happy with that. Also the build quality for the most part is very good, so coudos to the team on that front.</p>\n\n<p>Now to what I don't like, the Zipper already mentioned, no need to elaborate, just get it out guys. Second point I noticed just under a year of using is that the Strap on the right side deterioated very fast. (picture 4) I did look into it and noticed, it's the one on where I lift my pack up to put it on. So if you are like me lugging around a lot of weight, it's pretty much guarantieed to happen. I nail it down to the fact that they wanted a wide strap, that's still thin. Especially compared to my old Pack, where I didn't have as much deteriation with the same usage. (picture 5) This also leads to an uncomfortable wearing on the right side, but nothing I can't handle. Next up is the size ajustement doesn't seem to hold up for my pack. When I go walk around all day I have to pull them again every half hour or so. Also something I didn't have to do with the old one.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, for what they ask, ($250, plus tax, plus shipping, plus import = $350 for me) it's too much for too little. Don't get me wrong, I daylidrive it for the benefit of fitting my stuff with a bit more headroom, and to make sure I get what I paid for, but man is it ever expensive. So no matter how much I want to give it a good score, I can't give more then the 3/5 stars. The reason why I gave only 2 is due to the Zipper. So if you are on the fence of getting this pack and you're lifing in Canada/US, it's expensive but can be worth it if you lug around a lot of stuff. Outside don't get it unless you really need it. The fact that it will cost about 30-40% more due to fees is an absolute turnoff for me. Especially with the issues I've mentioned. So I'll use the BackPack till it's dead, or I find a suitable replacement for it. At this point I can only leave one last comment: Don't buy in the hype like I did.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Seems like I'm too dumb to add the pictures I mentioned, well guess one has to trust me</p>",

In addition, I really like how minimal the backpack overall and the LTT branding are - this carry-on is sleek and works well with most outfits.

I really like the fact that you can put a lot of things inside the backpack and the bag can take them all. I do appreciate that I can pack inside of the backpack for the weekend and I don't have to carry any extra bags with me. However, as a daily driver, the bag is way too bulky. I find that that, on most days, I barely use half of the space the backpack has. In addition, albeit the backpack fits under most of the airplane seats, it does not meet the dimension requirements on most budget European airlines. I have flown with the bag several times, I never had any issues but every check-in causes me a bit of a stress that I am going to pay extra for an oversized item.  </p>\n\n<p>The LTT backpack would be a perfect bag as it meets all of my needs if only it was smaller.

The bag with all of my daily cargo weights in at around 20lbs, maybe more if I have extra work to carry.

The ability to know where my stubby screw driver is at all times is also a bonus. no digging in the main pockets as it\u2019s has a dedicated pocket on the front. \n<br />I also like the look of the bag. It is very simple but well thought out. It has become my favorite LTT merch so far. The dedicated water bottle pocket is really nice as well. My white and orange bottle looks very nice with my bag. </p>\n\n<p>The negatives of my review: the bag had lots of cushioning in the straps, but this does nothing to prevent the center piece from putting pressure on my back.

Loading your items in the bag properly ( as in proper distribution of weight) will prevent it from falling over or not sitting up right. \n<br />I am extremely happy with my purchase and will be purchasing more merch soon!</p>",

Both me and my wife find it comfortable, despite a height difference of 9 inches and a weight difference of over 70 pounds. The many pockets are great to have so everything can have a designated place, which makes keeping the backpack organized very easy. I have a tiny gripe about those pockets though, and that is that is that some are really tight, and some are not. And the way I use it, it means really squeezing things into certain pockets when I\u2019m packing it. And in other cases with other pockets: finding the things I keep in them have fallen out. Very minor nitpick, and could probably be avoided with different item choice, but still worth mentioning. Over all very pleased with it, and I am excited to see how it holds up in the coming years.</p>",

This was my first piece of LTT merch even though I have been watching them since the early days of the Langley house. I was pretty skeptical of creator merch, so I judged this with a pretty harsh eye. I have worn this almost everyday since I got it (about 1.5 years) and on two vacations including flights (one international). I figured I could finally give a review.</p>\n\n<p>Carry:\n<br />Here is a list of things I have in it just about everyday:</p>\n\n<p>-2 16.5\" laptops + chargers (one work/one personal)\n<br />-1 anker 747 battery bank\n<br />-1 anker power brick\n<br />-1 IFixIt Pro Tech Toolkit\n<br />-1 Kline Multibit Driver\n<br />-assortment of cables including lightning, usb-c, RJ45,\n<br />-assortment of other misc. items including, candy, medication, pens, flashdrives\n<br />-sunglasses</p>\n\n<p>This is stuff that I never leave the house without, and leaves plenty of room for other stuff like a small jacket, more cables/chargers, cable tester, clothes, Nintendo Switch, 40oz LTT water bottle. It is pretty remarkable how much stuff it can carry. However, I would caution against using to to store clothes for any longer than on overnight bag. With the list above, it weights about 21lbs, about 17lbs with only one of the laptops.</p>\n\n<p>Quality:\n<br />It has been pretty good to me so far. I am not super kind to it either. I sling it to the floor/back of my car everyday 2+ times a day. The original carabiners have been fine, I expected them to be annoying/break. However I have really just ignored them, I would prefer to have standard carabiners but I don't even notice them. I overpacked it once for an overnight trip and now it is deformed. This is not a huge issue, however it is a little difficult to close the big tech pocket because it is bowed inward. But, as long as you don't test the limits of the bag you should be fine lol. No other signs of wear after a bit over a year of constant use. </p>\n\n<p>Usability:\n<br />Most bags that I have had have either not enough pockets/zippers or too many. This bag is a good in-between. The \"bag of holding\" part for all the big stuff is really nice. The bottom is actually wide and long enough to sit the iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit down flush, while the 40oz LTT water bottle is in the holder. The 40oz is a little big to be honest. It fits, but takes a little bit of doing and the zipper seems kinda tight there. I have never used the pocket inside of the bag of holding space. Good to just throw in a bunch of random things. The tech pocket is great. For a while I ran one laptop, but recently started having two. In the two pockets adjacent I have the Anker 747 power bank and a lightning cable and the laptop charger (if I have two laptops I throw one charger into the bag of holding). I don't usually carry an iPad or gaming device, so the other pockets are where I have a bunch of cables; USB-C, RJ45, coax, etc. The side pocket I keep a spare wall wart 65watt charger, a lightning cable, and a small USB-C to USB-C. The front is where I keep a screwdriver, pen, candy, meds, and thumb drives.</p>\n\n<p>Travel\n<br />As advertised, it fits great under an airplane seat even when packed to capacity (and a little over capacity). The pocket right behind your back was great to keep passports and cash secure, it was nice to know where they were and couldn't easily be accessed when on your person. Have not used the luggage strap or chest strapped (forgot where I put them).

But I understand what went into creating it, and it is a great bag. Maybe not 300 dollars good, but I have not regretted it for one second. For me it was worth every penny, but maybe not for someone who would not use it everyday. If this breaks down in a few years, I will probably buy another one\u2026 but after watching the Coal Miner bag breakdown I will probably have this a lot longer than that lol.</p>",

I have always wanted the LTT bag and decided to treat myself. I work an engineer where I'm in the office, but also out walking the field following power lines.

This does wear in to a more \"backpack\" shape in the first month or so. The laptop compartment is amazing. I can carry an 18\" HP Z-Book perfectly. This is about the max size it can hold, (do you really need anything bigger)? One thing that drew me in was the construction. I spent a ton of time researching this aspect and feel the reviews got it right. This is a tough bag! The straps and other pockets are good quality. The secondary pocket, \"the bag of holding\", is &amp;$%! huge. I can barely fill it up with everything I take day to day. Which is nice to know that I can fit a full outfit with me if I do a field walk in the Summer and need to change. Lastly, the price... This is an expensive bag and is a tough sell if money is tight. I would recommend this bag to someone who expects to use it daily, in bag conditions, carries a large amount of stuff routinely, ...AND... has the extra income to justify.

The LTT backpack is leagues better in terms of organization, visibility, durability, etc.  My one annoyance with the LTT backpack is that the top handle, while very strong, is honestly unconfortable compared to my old bag.  Due to its stiffness and lack of padding, the edges dig into your hand, rather than the weight being distributed across the entire width of the strap.  A little bit of stretch/padding would have gone a looooong way.  Granted, this is far from a dealbreaker, as being a backpack, I can just put it on my back if carrying it for more than a few seconds, but for the $250 price tag, the lack of stretch/padding is surprising considering how well thought-out the rest of the bag is.</p>",

Plus, shortly after ordering, I received an email informing that the backpack they sent didn't had the double reinforced bottom panel as advertised at the time. The solution offered was an extra warranty to cover the bottom panel, and offered a 25$ discount on my next purchase. This is ok, but not perfect, as I wanted my backpack to be.

            "body_html": "<p>Before I get too deep into my complaints, the backpack\u2019s layout is great for a person who wants/needs to carry a lot. Haven\u2019t had much time with it yet but as of now it seems like a great thing to use for short trips, but overkill for commuters. </p>\n\n<p>I was fairly excited to get the backpack, but the excitement dwindled a few days after I made my purchase when the news broke about the bottom section of the backpack not being as advertised. For some context, my current backpack lasted me ~7 years, before the bottom layer started falling apart. Based on LTTs advertising I was hoping this backpack would last me significantly longer because of the double layered design.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst I appreciate the new \u201dVirtual Double-Layer\u201d clause in the warranty, I do not know if I can trust that LTT would replace/fix the backpack, if it breaks after a similarly long period of time. Can I trust the warranty on a product that has been misrepresented? We can\u2019t know if any other parts of the backpack are not as described. Will LTT still exist in 7, 10, 15 years? What if potential new management comes around and has different ideas with regard to how to treat warranties. Would any backpack with a worn bottom layer be replaced, even if ofter elements are showing signs of wear?</p>\n\n<p>Initially options offered to customers were not clear enough. Eventually people who purchased a backpack got an email with more details, which made things even worse!</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m from the UK. Whilst LTT offered to cover return shipping for customers who choose to return the backpack, there was no offer to cover customs/import fees and taxes. As such I reached out to support for clarification. In return I got a dismissive and condescending response. They are blaming the lack of offer to cover import duty on their policies, but imho this should have been relaxed considering the misleading advertising situation). </p>\n\n<p>So in the end I am presented with 2 options:\n<br />- Return the backpack for a refund, excluding import costs. This would leave me \u00a349.74 out of pocket and nothing to show for it!\n<br />- Keep the backpack, which has already been misrepresented twice and hope for the best when it comes to quality of the item and the promised warranty coverage.\n<br /> \n<br />Call me picky, but neither is ideal.</p>\n\n<p>In a lame attempt to sweeten the deal for people who choose to keep the backpack they are offering a $25 in-sotre credit voucher, but with a catch! It EXPIRES at the end of February 2024. Talk about adding insult to injury. Additionally, the in-store credit doesn\u2019t really add much for overseas customers, considering taxes and shipping costs we\u2019d have to pay to use the credit.</p>\n\n<p>LTT posted a blog stating their commitment to making things right\u2026 The compensation scheme is just a farce. The whole thing is designed to save face. The credit they are offering as compensation expires quickly and needs to be spent in their own store.

            "body": "Before I get too deep into my complaints, the backpack\u2019s layout is great for a person who wants/needs to carry a lot. Haven\u2019t had much time with it yet but as of now it seems like a great thing to use for short trips, but overkill for commuters. \r\n\r\nI was fairly excited to get the backpack, but the excitement dwindled a few days after I made my purchase when the news broke about the bottom section of the backpack not being as advertised. For some context, my current backpack lasted me ~7 years, before the bottom layer started falling apart. Based on LTTs advertising I was hoping this backpack would last me significantly longer because of the double layered design.\r\n\r\nWhilst I appreciate the new \u201dVirtual Double-Layer\u201d clause in the warranty, I do not know if I can trust that LTT would replace/fix the backpack, if it breaks after a similarly long period of time. Can I trust the warranty on a product that has been misrepresented? We can\u2019t know if any other parts of the backpack are not as described. Will LTT still exist in 7, 10, 15 years? What if potential new management comes around and has different ideas with regard to how to treat warranties. Would any backpack with a worn bottom layer be replaced, even if ofter elements are showing signs of wear?\r\n\r\nInitially options offered to customers were not clear enough. Eventually people who purchased a backpack got an email with more details, which made things even worse!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m from the UK. Whilst LTT offered to cover return shipping for customers who choose to return the backpack, there was no offer to cover customs/import fees and taxes. As such I reached out to support for clarification. In return I got a dismissive and condescending response. They are blaming the lack of offer to cover import duty on their policies, but imho this should have been relaxed considering the misleading advertising situation). \r\n\r\nSo in the end I am presented with 2 options:\r\n- Return the backpack for a refund, excluding import costs. This would leave me \u00a349.74 out of pocket and nothing to show for it!\r\n- Keep the backpack, which has already been misrepresented twice and hope for the best when it comes to quality of the item and the promised warranty coverage.\r\n \r\nCall me picky, but neither is ideal.\r\n\r\nIn a lame attempt to sweeten the deal for people who choose to keep the backpack they are offering a $25 in-sotre credit voucher, but with a catch! It EXPIRES at the end of February 2024. Talk about adding insult to injury. Additionally, the in-store credit doesn\u2019t really add much for overseas customers, considering taxes and shipping costs we\u2019d have to pay to use the credit.\r\n\r\nLTT posted a blog stating their commitment to making things right\u2026 The compensation scheme is just a farce. The whole thing is designed to save face. The credit they are offering as compensation expires quickly and needs to be spent in their own store. Looks good on the surface, but I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide if you\u2019d consider it fair or customer friendly.\r\n\r\nTo wrap things up, I just want to say\u2026 Don\u2019t get me wrong, apparent quality and effort put in to the backpack is commendable, but when you buy a product the support around it is just as important as the item itself. The problem I have has more to do with inflexible policies considering the misrepresented product + condescending and dismissive support staff. Time will tell if more issues are unearthed.",

I have a super duper small issue with one stitch that isn't perfectly aligned and the shipping box came damaged (which is probably not LMGs fault, German customs just suck) also the bag wasn't perfectly cleaned. all of those are not big issues in the least, but to me as a student the money I paid for it forces me to expect perfection. This very problem of european import fees is also why I couldn't bring myself to get the screwdriver because it performs to a degree I can get with a domestic brand for half the price.

I want to say though, that as a luxury item, which both of these definitely are even though they have real value as well I am not regretting my buy!\r\n\r\nOverall i really love the backpack and my experience with it so far and I am thankful for the opportunity to finally get it and thus get my chance to support LMG as a fan, but I would say that a European warehouse would greatly improve the buying experience. \r\n\r\n-(at the time of review I have not yet used this Backpack to actually travel, but if the website allows me to I want to update this review after, i plan to use it for travelling really soon, and I hope it will replace my need for a suitcase on shorter trips like my old school bag has.) -\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

If they do plan to send out improved carabineer pulls they need to be either including a flyer or some similar in the delivery or maybe a dedicated email to people getting these things for reassurance.

Not mad at LTT they seem to be trying but I think ultimately what customers want is for the thing they were hyped about from a pitch standpoint to be close to what they actually get. If they do plan to send out improved carabineer pulls they need to be either including a flyer or some similar in the delivery or maybe a dedicated email to people getting these things for reassurance.

This leads to a look that can be considered box-y or bulky, but it functions quite nicely. It's a high quality bag, so it is not super light, but feels very durable.

This might come in handy sometimes, but to take full advantage of it I ended up buying the tech sack with the double layer credit so I can get better use out of that giant compartment. I also don't love that the zipper only goes down partially on one side due to the small compartments added to the side of the bag. As a matter of personal opinion I'd prefer those compartments be within another pocket to keep the lines clean for the overall appearance of the bag. That, plus now that I've known the joys of a compartment that opens out look a book, I don't know how I ever lived without it. \n<br />-the zippers are a bit stiff/sticky. This will change with time and use, i know, but it's the first time I've ever used a zipper and thought the feel could be better. Maybe it's just the water resistance causing the build tolerances to be tighter.</p>\n\n<p>Since those notes are my personal opinion and not going to be the same for everyone, I do feel that this bag was thoughtfully designed and tested and a high quality product was produced.

The backpack has possibly the best layout i have ever seen and is very spacious wich is great when taking trips to my local groceries store, or when taking long train trips with electronic devices like a laptop, steam deck, phone etc. The backpack feels good to have on, doing a fairly good job at spreading the weight across my back and chest, altough the strap that goes across the chest could be a tad longer. I live in a country with alot of snowfall this seasons, and i can safely say that the backpack is waterproof in atleast light rain and heavy snowfall. The backpack still looks new and is extremly durable, i also love having \n<br />safety carbins on the zipper, the easy access for a charging cable in the sidepouch is very convenient for my daily use also. 11/10 would buy again.</p>",

We're glad to hear that your experience with the backpack has been a positive one.</p>\n\n<p>I've checked over your previous communications with our customer support team and it would appear that the discount code you were attempting to use was reserved specifically for people who had requested a stock notification for a now-discontinued product. I apologize if this was not clear when you first reached out to us. However, I can confirm that it is correct that this particular promo code was not applied to your order.</p>\n\n<p>It is quite common for us to offer discount codes that can only be used by a portion of our overall userbase, however it is equally common for more-universal sales and promos to be announced in Linus Tech Tips content. We hope that you'll consider taking advantage of such promos in the future. Thanks again for being our customer!</p>\n\n<p>-Adam</p>",

First off the top handle/hangar. While the bag does stand up on its own I have a cat that would probably love to use his claws on this backpack and therefore at home I have to hang it up. With such a big back that can carry so many aforementioned things this bag gets HEAVY like heavier than a human toddler heavy. So the hanging it from the handoe causes the zipper at the top to crumple up making it difficult to zip and up zip whilst hung up. Which leads onto problem number two, the zippers. Now to be clear I am aware they promised new zippers to everyone free of charge but just like you don't review electronics with promised software updates in mind you don't review physical goods factoring in promised fixes that have not yet been fixed, I understand that it is probably easier said than done to design and manufacture new zipper pulls in that style but honestly I'd of preferred if they would just give us an option to take a replacement normal style pull with a nice braided tail on it cause quite frankly I don't like this kind of zipper anyway they are more hassle than I need and if I'm in the rate situation I am worried about theft out of my backpack I have a zipper padlock anyway (which can't be used on this style of zipper) that I would normally use. Imho an advanced pick pocket could easily unclip the zippere from each other and get in your bag without you noticing anyway so it's kind of gimmicky and makes the zippers a lot harder to use since I'm always worried about breaking them by applying to much force (which you sometimes have to do cause of the aforementioned issue when hanging the bag up) so I just hope they are not far away from shipping the zippers and hopefully they can include some normal style zipper pulls in there for those of us that do not want the current style of zipper. </p>\n\n<p>Which brings me on to my last issue. Not enough small internal pockets. You have that massive \"pouch of holding\" compartment why is there only one tiny zipped internal pouch in there!?! In my opinion there should be more pouches both zipped and open ended all over the walls of this compartment as small things in there often fall to the bottom and I end up having to unpack the whole backpack to find one dongle. This would take up basically zero room from that large compartment and add way more functionally. </p>\n\n<p>Another thing that was annoying but ultimately got fixed so can't be too mad is that their store charged me UK vat at the time of purchase despite being over the threshold of doing that where the shipping company chargers tax meaning in order to actually get the backpack I had to pay the shipping company tax as well and then contact the store customer service to get my money back for the tax I paid to them. I have seen other complaints about this as far back as when the backpack launched so they're clearly aware of this issue but haven't fixed it instead choosing to only refund people the tax that incorrectly charged only when they asked for it instead of not charging it. </p>\n\n<p>Overall I would probably not recommend that other people I know buy this backpack unless they are an absolute packrat. There are nicer and cheaper backpacks from a company like alpaka that would suit the average person a lot better for an EDC backpack especially if they only have 1 laptop 1 tablet/handheld and a few other bits and bobs like a normal person.</p>",

I also used this backpack to travel and they were not kidding when they said it \"barley\" fit under the seat. I had it filled to the max and it just fit under the seat. The bag is well balanced so when you have it on the floor it stands upright without tipping over (most of the time). The pocket inside the bag for the water bottle works great, but I wish it was on the outside because I utilize every inch inside the bag. The exterior pockets are great and the pockets inside make it easy to organize all your random, but needed items.   The material the bag is made of is heavy weight and seems like it will last a long time.</p>",

Everything fit perfectly and I was able to fit it under the airplane seat. I was very surprised how much I could fit. At the conference I would carry it around everywhere, I even met one person who peeped out it was LTT. It was much better than carrying around two separate bags.

The price very accurately reflects not only the quality, but the care and attention to detail that was put into its production. It aimed to fix every problem that other backpack manufacturers have at a price that isn't too far off from said brands.",

            "body_html": "<p>Marketed as a Tech bag, this backpack is capable and durable beyond office work and gaming gear. I purchased this bag for use as my daily driver I would use for work, primarily choosing it based on its size and ability to stand upright on its own in some capacity. I have enjoyed this bag since the day I bought it, and would consider it to be the best backpack I have purchased to date. There are several reasons for this, and definitely some small improvements that can always be made, but this thing is a beast. I have been using it in for around 7 months now, and have no visible signs of wear and tear let alone major damage. Looking at it as a write this review there is almost nothing to differentiate this from a brand new one. The sizing and coverage is phenomenal, I carry a lot of stuff and there is still room for me to carry more in this thing. The straps feel really good to wear, even if they are a little hard when you first feel them, and every stress area on the bag is double reinforced to cover my industrial needs. I love the metal buckles on the main straps, and the zippers are clean and stiff even after months of 10-15 zips a day in dusty conditions. The shoulder straps change length a bit too easy for me, but this is a trade off to make sure the buckles aren't digging into and cutting the straps or causing unneeded wear and tear, and so far the backpack has held fantastically. Normally, after around this amount of time, I would start to see fraying at the tension points at the base of the strap because of how I sling it on and off of my back by one strap all day. So far, I have been extremely happy not to. I am still wary, but even if it decays at the current rate I will get 10 years out of this bag no sweat. I can't imagine finding a better bag right now to suit my needs, but I still have some recommendations for a version 2.0 if it ever comes. See the bottom of review.\n<br />Lets go pocket to pocket and talk about my use case and its features.\n<br />Starting closest to the back, the laptop pocket is more of a laptop bag in and of itself. I easily put my 17\" laptop in there, charger cables and mouse in the opposite deep pouches, and between them literally an entire ream of blank paper used for the printer we will talk about later. In the smaller pockets is a spiral bound notebook, 2 folders with 30 pages each, and 2 cardboard dividers I placed inside to keep the paper stiff and upright during walking. The pocket zips all the way down to the base, and splays open like a Folio for me when I need to grab something inside especially with how I use the cardboard dividers. This pocket has as much capacity as my previous satchel style computer bag, and keeps everything organized. The laptop sleeve is just right for sliding in and out, and honestly I could fit more than this if I wanted to.\n<br />The main pocket is quite large, mostly being one open chamber and a small zip pouch on the back wall. All sides of this are lightly padded, especially the bottom of the bag to prevent your stuff from being knocked around too much when you set the bag down. In the main space I keep a portable printer, a 10' extension cable, a 3 way outlet splitter, and an industrial GFCI with size for a sweat shirt if i wanted. The small pocket holds the printer cables. There is also an interior water bottle sleeve, which I store a 24 ounce water bottle in all the time. The interior placement is very good for durability, as the pouch isn't being stretched and rubbed on everything outside you touch, but the interior placement definitely makes spills feel more stressful so keep that in mind if you carry a lot of leaky bottles. \n<br />The remaining pockets are small item pouches, one on the side and one of on the front, plus one glasses sleeve. I keep a pair of safety glasses in the sleeve, which works great but is not hard sided. The fabric in the pouch also attracted dirt and is difficult to clean, so be careful if you are often placing dusty glasses in the sleeve and consider a microfiber liner which can be removed and washed. The front pocket is all various office supplies, pens, pencils, markers, tape, extra cables, and a folding knife. Everything fits well, but if i nit pick the fabric is a little tight so sliding rubber covered pens or larger items into the slots can be a chore, and i would want 2 pen slots instead of 1. Ironically, I do not keep a screwdriver in the long slot, but it works great for mass storage of writing implements or a knife. The side pocket i basically never use, cause there is so much space everywhere else. I'd throw flash drives or something in there, or would use that pocket for a power bank if i wanted to walk and charge since it has no zip access. \n<br />Recommendations: Fitted dividers for the laptop pocket, similar to the external attachment for luggage, Hard sided for documents. Metal clips for chest strap. Magnetic attachment point in the strap for phone/equipment. Extra pen slot. Extra bottom padding. Velcro for patches</p>",

This bag really feels like it checks all the boxes. It has spaces for a full size laptop, a full size tablet, and something else in the soft pockets of the one section. The larger \"bag of holding\" area holds my tech sack, a small first aid kit, a mid sized bluetooth speaker,and a few other things. I like that the waterbottle sleeve is internal, so I know its not going to fall out when I throw my bag in and out of my car. The front zipper area has plenty of space for all your little things that you dont want to get lost in the bigger compartments. The built in spot for the LTT screwdriver is perfect, as I am an IT tech and I'm always grabbing my screwdriver for something. The exterior has been holding up great to any moisture or dirt that gets on it and it cleans up great. I like that the sternum strap is removeable as I don't really need it. The ONLY negative I can give this bag is that when I purchased it, it was advertised that it wouldnt sag and tip over like other bags. Its a tall order, and unfortunatly this bag does it also. I dont blame LTT at all for this, when you load up a bag with heavy stuff, its gonna happen. Its still pretty rigid and doesnt ALWAYS tip over, but it can happen. I'm still 100% satisfied with this bag and would recommend it to any tech person who is looking for a top quality bag.</p>",

Sturdy straps, good quality material and plenty of pockets and compartments made it for me the best option. I would have give it 5 starts if not for my only two observations i have for it: the laptop compartment is lacking padding at the bottom, I added a small roll of bubble rap to compensate for this, and the second thing is, I would prefer if it had the water compartment on the outside. I know I can attach a bottle to the strap outside but it would swing around so I don't like it. Other than that i think the bag is perfect. If the ever come out with a rev two of it with these two things covered i would purchase it again for the upgrade.</p>",

I work at a luggage store and both myself and my managers were impressed by how the backpack compares to similar options from TravelPro and Briggs &amp; Riley. I've taken it on four flights and really have no complaints so far, but I do have some words of advice for potential buyers. First, if you're not paying attention, the backpack can be very heavy when fully packed. I would recommend trying to fill it up with lighter but still bulky items such as clothing. Second, if you plan to have it sitting on top of four-wheeler luggage, put some heavier items in the back compartment or it can be prone to tipping over. All-in-all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would happily recommend it to anyone looking for a premium travel bag. (Unless you're in our store, in which case I'll have to point you to something we actually sell) XD</p>",
            "body": "I bought this backpack for an underseat companion to my carry-on luggage. It works great and fits a lot more than I was expecting. I work at a luggage store and both myself and my managers were impressed by how the backpack compares to similar options from TravelPro and Briggs & Riley.

It's a minor issue, but it's odd that only one side does it. The other issue is that it falls over forward all the time, even with my massive engineering laptop in the laptop compartment counter balancing it.

There are a ton of great features and one can tell that the team designing it put a ton of thought into it.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n - Fits chonki boi laptops\r\n - Laptop compartment opens the perfect amount\r\n - Integrated water bottle and screwdriver pocket\r\n - Comfortable\r\n - Holds all of my daily carry things\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n - Right side strap constantly comes loose\r\n - It falls over even when full\r\n - I don't like the zipper pulls, I wish they were normal \r\n\r\nFor some reason, and maybe it's how I pick the bag up, the right side shoulder strap has to be tightened every single time I put it on. It's a minor issue, but it's odd that only one side does it. The other issue is that it falls over forward all the time, even with my massive engineering laptop in the laptop compartment counter balancing it. I have to place my backpack up against something (straps away from the thing it's leaning against) to prevent it from falling over.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I'm satisfied with it, I just wish the two issues weren't a thing.",

I have had this for months now , some thoughts on long term use. The zipper pulls are hot garbage, most are already bent. The bag tends to lean and fall over away from the straps,  even with 2 laptop in it. The larger cargo area always collapses and loses its shape. No internal cable management like the Mos Black Paks(what I used before this). Needs more storage pockets for small things . Also wished it opened flat like my old BlackPack. I very much like the water resistant nature of the fabric , so far it has stayed dry inside after walking through some decent rain. Price to performance is not that good at 100 dollars more than my last back pack. If I wasn't a LTT fan , I probably would have not bought the pack.</p>",
            "body": "The good , durable material and size . Live the lighter color inside, helps with finding things . Wish the water bottle holder was a tad larger for the 40 oz bottles. I have had this for months now , some thoughts on long term use. The zipper pulls are hot garbage, most are already bent. The bag tends to lean and fall over away from the straps,  even with 2 laptop in it. The larger cargo area always collapses and loses its shape. No internal cable management like the Mos Black Paks(what I used before this). Needs more storage pockets for small things . Also wished it opened flat like my old BlackPack.

I carry a 16-inch MBP, 12.9\" iPad Pro, 16-inch Lenovo Legion gaming laptop (used for cybersecurity work), 40 oz. water bottle, books, cables, and bunch of smaller tech gear items, etc. with me regularly. This bag holds it all well. It can be heavy with all of the stuff in it when I have it fully loaded out but it rest well on the shoulders and back. Loved it so much, got my wife one as well. We put different colored zipper pulls on the bag to quickly tell each of ours apart from the other. Great bag!</p>",

So far this is the best pack I've used. Before this I was using the large MOS backpack, which was great, but was too long/tall and caused extra stress on my back. The LTT backpack has been great on my back so far, and using the chest straps also helps me to maintain good posture while carrying a metric ton of stuff. Thank you to Linus and the rest of the team for putting together such a well thought out backpack! The only thing I would have liked more, would be a few extra pockets in the Compartment of Holding!

The straps\n<br />Although the Satches shoulder straps are much more uncomfortable than the LTTs padding, it does get one thing right: The straps are not connected to each other, which gives my neck more freedom of movement when turning my head. Personally, I do not see any reason for not using the Satches method of separately connected straps. \n<br />2. The bottom. \n<br />The Satch has a more sturdy and in my opinion durable bottom, which is even more better for a backpack. It is soft yet more firm than what LTT has utilized and I'd honestly love to see a newer similar implementation in V2 or the Mini.\n<br />3. Reflective Straps \n<br />I'd like to see some reflective straps added to the design. I do understand that the backpack would be less stealthy, but being a European bike rider, I'd like to have my backpack be able to protect me a bit more.\n<br />4. A rain cover\n<br />The Satch has an optional rain cover that you can buy cheaply. It does not look great but makes me feel safe from a lot of rain, etc. Although the water-resistant zippers are nice to see, I really would like to see an actual protector that I can put away when not needed. Considering the price I'd even expect it to be shipped with the backpack. What if people who already own the backpack could get it as a bonus bin item?\n<br />5. A straps \"holder\"\n<br />When I ride my bike, I have a lot of wind resistance going against me. When this happens, the straps love to fly around and hit my arms, being a great annoyance when riding. To be fair, my Satch only had a strap holder at the chest strap, but I'd like to see such an implementation on every strap, so they cannot just fly around meaninglessly. </p>\n\n<p>Now for some this review might have come across as negative, but I can assure you it is not. \n<br />For the first time ever nearly everything in my backpack has its place. My mouse, tablet, Laptop, power bank, cables, and more have all a place to be, so I do not have to search and \"pray\" to find what I'm looking for. Getting my peripherals used to be such a pain. Now it's a breeze! The backpack can also hold *a lot* more stuff than before, whilst technically being smaller (25.5L vs 30L). I credit the \"boxy\" design for that. I love that the internals are all orange! I can see everything inside, which is really nice! \n<br />There are a lot of things I love about this backpack that I will not list here, but if you have the spare cash and you are a techie by blood (just like me), this thing is very worth it!</p>\n\n<p>This backpack has had a lot of love and work put into it. Now I am hoping for a V2/Mini Version with some upgrades that will make it legendary (although it already is)!\n<br />Considering how much market research and work Satch has put into its backpacks, it is quite impressive to see such a competitive backpack. All we need now is for you to copy some of the German engineering :D (Please, anyone from Creator Warehouse, just buy a Satch backpack and learn from it, it's a good backpack of its own).\n<br />Massive credits to the whole team and everyone who has been working on this, or frankly any products in this store. You rock!</p>",

I do understand that the backpack would be less stealthy, but being a European bike rider, I'd like to have my backpack be able to protect me a bit more.\r\n4. A rain cover\r\nThe Satch has an optional rain cover that you can buy cheaply. It does not look great but makes me feel safe from a lot of rain, etc. Although the water-resistant zippers are nice to see, I really would like to see an actual protector that I can put away when not needed. Considering the price I'd even expect it to be shipped with the backpack. What if people who already own the backpack could get it as a bonus bin item?\r\n5. A straps \"holder\"\r\nWhen I ride my bike, I have a lot of wind resistance going against me. When this happens, the straps love to fly around and hit my arms, being a great annoyance when riding. To be fair, my Satch only had a strap holder at the chest strap, but I'd like to see such an implementation on every strap, so they cannot just fly around meaninglessly. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow for some this review might have come across as negative, but I can assure you it is not. \r\nFor the first time ever nearly everything in my backpack has its place. My mouse, tablet, Laptop, power bank, cables, and more have all a place to be, so I do not have to search and \"pray\" to find what I'm looking for. Getting my peripherals used to be such a pain. Now it's a breeze! The backpack can also hold *a lot* more stuff than before, whilst technically being smaller (25.5L vs 30L). I credit the \"boxy\" design for that. I love that the internals are all orange! I can see everything inside, which is really nice! \r\nThere are a lot of things I love about this backpack that I will not list here, but if you have the spare cash and you are a techie by blood (just like me), this thing is very worth it!\r\n\r\nThis backpack has had a lot of love and work put into it. Now I am hoping for a V2/Mini Version with some upgrades that will make it legendary (although it already is)!\r\nConsidering how much market research and work Satch has put into its backpacks, it is quite impressive to see such a competitive backpack. All we need now is for you to copy some of the German engineering :D (Please, anyone from Creator Warehouse, just buy a Satch backpack and learn from it, it's a good backpack of its own).\r\nMassive credits to the whole team and everyone who has been working on this, or frankly any products in this store. You rock!",

I plan to swap out the bits for the LTT ones when I get them. I use it for my work in the offshore industry as a Junior Engineer. The Bookbag I enjoy using as well. Best thing by far is a dedicated device compartment that can house several devices and accessories like a mouse or charger.  I will say however that as a 17\" laptop user you won't get the best experience as the sleeve is very tight. Not an issue if you aren't pulling a 17\" laptop out almost daily like I do. In my case I use the large middle section of that compartment and placed my steam deck in the catch all section instead. I found that to be most comfortable and it doesnt bother me to do so with my 17\". It's beyond perfect when I used my wife's 15\" as a test since I could fit my steam deck, her tablet and a old 13\" we had as well as controllers, mouse, and 2 big chargers. If I had anything I would gripe about this backpack, that one thing would be a lack of a paperwork like section sleeve in the large compartment. A lot of industry and military careers still require you to keep your certifications and licenses on you or made available to be physically seen when requested. As it's something I don't need often but have to carry, I don't really want it in my nice laptop compartment that I am in and out of constantly. Other than that it's a perfect backpack for my uses as a laptop bag and as a bag to hold some of my tools when I am working.</p>",

Coming from designers experienced with tech, they did a great job with the sleeves and materials in the laptop pocket.

I don't consider this a downside though, for a couple reasons. The weight is clearly justified, as it comes from the high quality materials and design. The weight is also more than made up for by the excellent straps which hold the bag so comfortably and securely on my back that it feels like it's quite a bit lighter than it is.</p>\n\n<p>I only have two actual critiques of the bag. First, I'm not a fan of the way the small front pocket opens, though this is quite minor and I do consider this more of a personal preference thing than a flaw with the bag. Second, and this is the main reason I've given the bag 4 stars instead of 5, is the overall size and shape. It looks and feels like it's a lot bigger than my old bag, so I ended up pretty disappointed the first time I packed it full and discovered it only fit marginally more stuff inside. I think this is due to the more square shape compared to most backpacks which ends up looking bulkier. I do understand that this shape maximizes capacity while fitting within airline size restrictions, but I think they went a little too far here, especially for a smaller person such as myself.</p>",

In fact, I've had to bend them back each time I close the bag.\n<br />I love the metal strap adjusters, and that for the most part the bag stands up by itself. I wish the laptop sleeve was just a tad bigger as I use a 17\" laptop, but for my textbooks and everything else it works fine, just have to put my laptop at the bottom (not in the laptop part). I enjoy the internal water bottle holder, as I can fit my glass bottle in there, and still fit my 64 oz water bottle in the same pocket. The different pockets have been great to store things like hand towels, microfiber towels to clean off my glasses and welding hood, and the front pocket is great to hold small things as well as pencils and even my wallet.\n<br />Is this a prefect bag? No. But, It's a pretty decent bag, zipper pulls aside. That's the only big drawback. It's definitely super annoying and I'm lucky I've been careful and cognizant of the fact that they are very fragile.

With that said, the chest strap helps even everything out. My third and final gripe is with the luggage strap on the back.
