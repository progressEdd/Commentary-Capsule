My Backpack can stand, holds everything I need without being heavy on the shoulders (to my taste the shoulder straps are a tiny bit too wide, but this is far better than having them too thin. My last backpack would cut into my shoulders leaving heavy bruises when I carried large amounts of groceries, I didn't try with this bag yet, but it shouldn't have that issue) I can put all the stuff from my daily loadout as both a student and a tech repair enthusiast in this bag at the same time without mixing them too much and it is awesome. As this bag is bigger than my last it will also not have a problem holding enough stuff to travel comfortably for about 8 days for me. </p>\\n\\n<p>Now, why would I not give 5 stars if my first impression review is so great? The issue is the value this bag proposes to me as a European. The Backpack is listed as a 250$ product, but after the horrible conversion rate, shipping (which i got for free), VAT, and customs I paid literally 42% more than that, which proposes this bag at around 350€, which puts it into the super high end boutique backpack manufacturies territory for its price. I have a super duper small issue with one stitch that isn't perfectly aligned and the shipping box came damaged (which is probably not LMGs fault, German customs just suck) also the bag wasn't perfectly cleaned. all of those are not big issues in the least, but to me as a student the money I paid for it forces me to expect perfection. This very problem of european import fees is also why I couldn't bring myself to get the screwdriver because it performs to a degree I can get with a domestic brand for half the price. I want to say though, that as a luxury item, which both of these definitely are even though they have real value as well I am not regretting my buy!</p>\\n\\n<p>Overall i really love the backpack and my experience with it so far and I am thankful for the opportunity to finally get it and thus get my chance to support LMG as a fan, but I would say that a European warehouse would greatly improve the buying experience. </p>\\n\\n<p>-(at the time of review I have not yet used this Backpack to actually travel, but if the website allows me to I want to update this review after, i plan to use it for travelling really soon, and I hope it will replace my need for a suitcase on shorter trips like my old school bag has.) -</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\", 'body': \"My last REAL backpack carried me through grade 5 - 12 and the first semester of university in Germany.

My last backpack would cut into my shoulders leaving heavy bruises when I carried large amounts of groceries, I didn't try with this bag yet, but it shouldn't have that issue) I can put all the stuff from my daily loadout as both a student and a tech repair enthusiast in this bag at the same time without mixing them too much and it is awesome. As this bag is bigger than my last it will also not have a problem holding enough stuff to travel comfortably for about 8 days for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, why would I not give 5 stars if my first impression review is so great? The issue is the value this bag proposes to me as a European. The Backpack is listed as a 250$ product, but after the horrible conversion rate, shipping (which i got for free), VAT, and customs I paid literally 42% more than that, which proposes this bag at around 350€, which puts it into the super high end boutique backpack manufacturies territory for its price. I have a super duper small issue with one stitch that isn't perfectly aligned and the shipping box came damaged (which is probably not LMGs fault, German customs just suck) also the bag wasn't perfectly cleaned. all of those are not big issues in the least, but to me as a student the money I paid for it forces me to expect perfection. This very problem of european import fees is also why I couldn't bring myself to get the screwdriver because it performs to a degree I can get with a domestic brand for half the price. I want to say though, that as a luxury item, which both of these definitely are even though they have real value as well I am not regretting my buy!\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall i really love the backpack and my experience with it so far and I am thankful for the opportunity to finally get it and thus get my chance to support LMG as a fan, but I would say that a European warehouse would greatly improve the buying experience. \\r\\n\\r\\n-(at the time of review I have not yet used this Backpack to actually travel, but if the website allows me to I want to update this review after, i plan to use it for travelling really soon, and I hope it will replace my need for a suitcase on shorter trips like my old school bag has.) -\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading!\", 'verified_buyer': True, 'created_at': '2024-01-14T00:44:49.591Z', 'reviewer_name': 'qgame', 'reviewer_initial': 'q', 'cf_answers': [], 'reply_content': None, 'pictures_urls': [], 'video_external_ids': [], 'thumb_up': 6, 'thumb_down': 0, 'location_country': 'Germany', 'location_country_code': 'DE', 'location': '(Koenigs Wusterhausen, DE)', 'source': None, 'product_title': 'Backpack', 'encoded_product_id': 'WVvBRKZ1', 'encoded_shop_id': '7DLmvQay', 'is_shopify_lite': False, 'product_url': '/products/backpack', 'product_url_with_utm': 'https://www.lttstore.com/products/backpack?jdgm_referral_location=product&ref=judge.me&utm_campaign=judgeme-review-site&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=judgeme', 'product_in_store': True, 'profile_img_idx': 7, 'avatar_image_url': None, 'gravatar_hash': None, 'media_platform_hosted_video_infos': [], 'country_code_show_flag': 'DE', 'pinned': None, 'in_a_group': False, 'shop_reply_name': 'lttstore.com', 'verified_purchase': True, 'reviewer_public_slug': None, 'reviewer_public_id': 'WPVlJMRG', 'collected_source': 'invite', 'has_coupon': False}, {'uuid': '4608db11-e9a6-4a54-89cd-bb36f8424763', 'title': 'Just great', 'rating': 5, 'body_html': '<p>I purchased 3 backpacks at the same time as Christmas presents.

I purchased this bag for use as my daily driver I would use for work, primarily choosing it based on its size and ability to stand upright on its own in some capacity. I have enjoyed this bag since the day I bought it, and would consider it to be the best backpack I have purchased to date. There are several reasons for this, and definitely some small improvements that can always be made, but this thing is a beast. I have been using it in for around 7 months now, and have no visible signs of wear and tear let alone major damage. Looking at it as a write this review there is almost nothing to differentiate this from a brand new one. The sizing and coverage is phenomenal, I carry a lot of stuff and there is still room for me to carry more in this thing. The straps feel really good to wear, even if they are a little hard when you first feel them, and every stress area on the bag is double reinforced to cover my industrial needs. I love the metal buckles on the main straps, and the zippers are clean and stiff even after months of 10-15 zips a day in dusty conditions. The shoulder straps change length a bit too easy for me, but this is a trade off to make sure the buckles aren\\'t digging into and cutting the straps or causing unneeded wear and tear, and so far the backpack has held fantastically. Normally, after around this amount of time, I would start to see fraying at the tension points at the base of the strap because of how I sling it on and off of my back by one strap all day. So far, I have been extremely happy not to. I am still wary, but even if it decays at the current rate I will get 10 years out of this bag no sweat. I can\\'t imagine finding a better bag right now to suit my needs, but I still have some recommendations for a version 2.0 if it ever comes. See the bottom of review.\\n<br />Lets go pocket to pocket and talk about my use case and its features.\\n<br />Starting closest to the back, the laptop pocket is more of a laptop bag in and of itself. I easily put my 17\" laptop in there, charger cables and mouse in the opposite deep pouches, and between them literally an entire ream of blank paper used for the printer we will talk about later. In the smaller pockets is a spiral bound notebook, 2 folders with 30 pages each, and 2 cardboard dividers I placed inside to keep the paper stiff and upright during walking. The pocket zips all the way down to the base, and splays open like a Folio for me when I need to grab something inside especially with how I use the cardboard dividers. This pocket has as much capacity as my previous satchel style computer bag, and keeps everything organized. The laptop sleeve is just right for sliding in and out, and honestly I could fit more than this if I wanted to.\\n<br />The main pocket is quite large, mostly being one open chamber and a small zip pouch on the back wall. All sides of this are lightly padded, especially the bottom of the bag to prevent your stuff from being knocked around too much when you set the bag down. In the main space I keep a portable printer, a 10\\' extension cable, a 3 way outlet splitter, and an industrial GFCI with size for a sweat shirt if i wanted. The small pocket holds the printer cables. There is also an interior water bottle sleeve, which I store a 24 ounce water bottle in all the time. The interior placement is very good for durability, as the pouch isn\\'t being stretched and rubbed on everything outside you touch, but the interior placement definitely makes spills feel more stressful so keep that in mind if you carry a lot of leaky bottles. \\n<br />The remaining pockets are small item pouches, one on the side and one of on the front, plus one glasses sleeve. I keep a pair of safety glasses in the sleeve, which works great but is not hard sided. The fabric in the pouch also attracted dirt and is difficult to clean, so be careful if you are often placing dusty glasses in the sleeve and consider a microfiber liner which can be removed and washed. The front pocket is all various office supplies, pens, pencils, markers, tape, extra cables, and a folding knife. Everything fits well, but if i nit pick the fabric is a little tight so sliding rubber covered pens or larger items into the slots can be a chore, and i would want 2 pen slots instead of 1.

Velcro for patches</p>', 'body': 'Marketed as a Tech bag, this backpack is capable and durable beyond office work and gaming gear. I purchased this bag for use as my daily driver I would use for work, primarily choosing it based on its size and ability to stand upright on its own in some capacity. I have enjoyed this bag since the day I bought it, and would consider it to be the best backpack I have purchased to date. There are several reasons for this, and definitely some small improvements that can always be made, but this thing is a beast. I have been using it in for around 7 months now, and have no visible signs of wear and tear let alone major damage. Looking at it as a write this review there is almost nothing to differentiate this from a brand new one. The sizing and coverage is phenomenal, I carry a lot of stuff and there is still room for me to carry more in this thing. The straps feel really good to wear, even if they are a little hard when you first feel them, and every stress area on the bag is double reinforced to cover my industrial needs. I love the metal buckles on the main straps, and the zippers are clean and stiff even after months of 10-15 zips a day in dusty conditions. The shoulder straps change length a bit too easy for me, but this is a trade off to make sure the buckles aren\\'t digging into and cutting the straps or causing unneeded wear and tear, and so far the backpack has held fantastically. Normally, after around this amount of time, I would start to see fraying at the tension points at the base of the strap because of how I sling it on and off of my back by one strap all day. So far, I have been extremely happy not to. I am still wary, but even if it decays at the current rate I will get 10 years out of this bag no sweat. I can\\'t imagine finding a better bag right now to suit my needs, but I still have some recommendations for a version 2.0 if it ever comes. See the bottom of review.\\r\\nLets go pocket to pocket and talk about my use case and its features.\\r\\nStarting closest to the back, the laptop pocket is more of a laptop bag in and of itself. I easily put my 17\" laptop in there, charger cables and mouse in the opposite deep pouches, and between them literally an entire ream of blank paper used for the printer we will talk about later. In the smaller pockets is a spiral bound notebook, 2 folders with 30 pages each, and 2 cardboard dividers I placed inside to keep the paper stiff and upright during walking. The pocket zips all the way down to the base, and splays open like a Folio for me when I need to grab something inside especially with how I use the cardboard dividers. This pocket has as much capacity as my previous satchel style computer bag, and keeps everything organized. The laptop sleeve is just right for sliding in and out, and honestly I could fit more than this if I wanted to.\\r\\nThe main pocket is quite large, mostly being one open chamber and a small zip pouch on the back wall. All sides of this are lightly padded, especially the bottom of the bag to prevent your stuff from being knocked around too much when you set the bag down. In the main space I keep a portable printer, a 10\\' extension cable, a 3 way outlet splitter, and an industrial GFCI with size for a sweat shirt if i wanted. The small pocket holds the printer cables. There is also an interior water bottle sleeve, which I store a 24 ounce water bottle in all the time. The interior placement is very good for durability, as the pouch isn\\'t being stretched and rubbed on everything outside you touch, but the interior placement definitely makes spills feel more stressful so keep that in mind if you carry a lot of leaky bottles. \\r\\nThe remaining pockets are small item pouches, one on the side and one of on the front, plus one glasses sleeve. I keep a pair of safety glasses in the sleeve, which works great but is not hard sided. The fabric in the pouch also attracted dirt and is difficult to clean, so be careful if you are often placing dusty glasses in the sleeve and consider a microfiber liner which can be removed and washed. The front pocket is all various office supplies, pens, pencils, markers, tape, extra cables, and a folding knife. Everything fits well, but if i nit pick the fabric is a little tight so sliding rubber covered pens or larger items into the slots can be a chore, and i would want 2 pen slots instead of 1. Ironically, I do not keep a screwdriver in the long slot, but it works great for mass storage of writing implements or a knife. The side pocket i basically never use, cause there is so much space everywhere else. I\\'d throw flash drives or something in there, or would use that pocket for a power bank if i wanted to walk and charge since it has no zip access. \\r\\nRecommendations: Fitted dividers for the laptop pocket, similar to the external attachment for luggage, Hard sided for documents.

I am comparing this against a Everki Concept 2 that I was using previously, and will likely continue to use the LTT backpack over it. A few things I would like to see in a future version: some harder reinforcement in the corners to protect the overall laptop area, easier ways to cinch up and release the shoulder straps on the go, I feel having a pocket on both sides would serve storage better(can have a loop above pocket for those who want to attach something still), and lastly maybe a secondary zipper on the front pocket that allows it to \"pop\" out and have a larger storage area.

Been using this backpack for several months now. Strong materials, comfortable straps, padding where it counts. I am comparing this against a Everki Concept 2 that I was using previously, and will likely continue to use the LTT backpack over it. A few things I would like to see in a future version: some harder reinforcement in the corners to protect the overall laptop area, easier ways to cinch up and release the shoulder straps on the go, I feel having a pocket on both sides would serve storage better(can have a loop above pocket for those who want to attach something still), and lastly maybe a secondary zipper on the front pocket that allows it to \"pop\" out and have a larger storage area.

Quality is 10/10. This won’t work for everyone’s use cases, so given the cost of it, make sure it will meet your needs with how you want it to use it. </p>\\n\\n<p>The Bad</p>\\n\\n<p>Main issue : The luggage strap I would classify as just above useless. This is the main reason I bought the backpack because I wanted a good backpack that could be dropped onto my roller when going through the airport. Unfortunately, making the luggage strap removeable means it is not as tight as it should be as the Velcro only has one position to tighten it and the elastic loops it hooks to will stretch, further loosening it.  I’ve ended up with the backpack spinning around the luggage handle and hanging off it on my roller bag while walking. As well, since it’s not pulled tight to the luggage handle, it will lean out and can make the roller unstable in a static standing position requiring you to lean it on something or keeping a hand on it while you get your coffee in the airport. This is even when the luggage strap is in the highest position on the backpack.</p>\\n\\n<p>Minor points : The design, is really setup for individual cords, battery packs, electronics, etc. to be stored in all the various pockets and pouches. I am setup differently and have a mesh bag that holds all my travel cords, etc. This means the two outer pockets (large front one and smaller side one) I don’t use. I keep a couple of things in there that are not frequently accessed (spare cell phone, backup ID and credit card) but they are not useful for me. The mesh bag I keep in the large holding pouch.</p>\\n\\n<p>Carrying handle : If you have the backpack loaded up and are using the carrying handle for an extended period for some reason, while strong, it’s not ergonomic as it’s very flat. It will cut into your hand and fatigue it quickly. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of.</p>\\n\\n<p>Shoulder Straps : I’ve found the straps will loosen when you’re not wearing it, such as when you are dragging it out of an airport overhead bin or from under the seat, or even sometimes taking it on or off. The buckles are great when there is tension on them, but when there is no tension on them (eg not wearing the backpack) I find they will loosen. As such when putting it back on, I need to re-adjust the straps. Again not a huge deal, but annoying in the aisle of an airplane. A lock on the buckles would be nice to keep them set.</p>\\n\\n<p>Size : It’s big, like really big. If you are using it as your only travel back for a 2-day, even 3-day trip, it’s great (I’ve done this). If it’s your second bag, on top of your roller when travelling, it’s over kill. If it’s packed full it will be tight under an airline seat. Making it about 2/3 of the current size I think would be better as the secondary travel bag use case. However, ONLY reduce the size of the large pouch of holding, the electronics side of the backpack is a great size as that side is normally pretty full.</p>\\n\\n<p>Price : It’s expensive. Not saying it’s not worth it, but watch the reviews (especially the 3rd party ones) and ensure there isn’t something in the design that will disappoint you, like the luggage strap did for me.  As a Canadian, with the shipping and exchange rate it came out to just over $400 CAD. </p>\\n\\n<p>The Good : </p>\\n\\n<p>Quality : The build quality on this really is second to none. I’d be surprised if there are any issue with it in the next 10 years.

The interior pouches are well thought out and hold a variety of things if you are using them for that. I keep an e-reader in a pouch for quick easy access for instance.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sunglass pouch : This on the outside and I actually use it for my passport. When travelling international through airports this document needs to be easy to get at but secure (maybe RFID shield this pouch in the future?) and this pouch works really well for that.</p>\\n\\n<p>Size : It’s Big, like really big, it will work great as a weekend bag, or as a go bag for IT work, students dragging tons of stuff around day to day. The electronics pouch is a great size, I frequently need to carry 3 laptops for work (yes through airports) and they all fit comfortably in the electronics side of the back pack with room to spare with room to spare for more. The large pouch is great for extras, full size headset, mesh bag of cables, other large bulky items.

Yes, I'm aware that the dimensions were clearly printed in the description for what size it can accommodate. I was just hoping honestly. So for now my laptop just has to sit in the back but not in a sleeve. Also at least for my use case the miscellaneous little pockets just aren't quite big enough for the amount of cables I carry around. On top of which the bigger middle pocket I guess for me is too big. Again not the fault of LTT, they put a lot of thought into this backpack, and well... you can't please everyone. All in all it really just comes down to the backpack not being for me. I'm going to hold on to it and use it as best I can and maybe someday it'll be exactly what I need.

I'm sure that the laptop would fit if the sleep was sewn to the sides of the bag and not the seem between the side and back. Or maybe if it just had a couple extra centimeters of material. I do understand though that my laptop being what it is, is wider front to back than most laptops.

Fits perfect there, with some additional USB cables.\\r\\n- Accessories like hotspot, Ethernet adapter, cabling, etc, all fit in the internal slot within the middle pocket, facing the users back, sharing the wall with the main laptop pocket.\\r\\n- Jeans, dress shirt, socks, 3 USB-PD wall-worts, half dozen USB cables, selfie stick, and a few other camera accessories all fit in the middle pocket.\\r\\n- Outer main pocket contains two mice, two smaller Qi battery banks, coins, pens, and a stylus. \\r\\n- Outer man slit pocket, just above the last, I throw in my passport and a few other items.\\r\\n- Outer side pocket. I have my Insta360 One X2 with magnetic camera mount.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that said, it fits a ton of stuff. The one main complaint is that this sucker is big. Even when empty, it\\'s a large-frame bag. As long as you are cool with that, you\\'re good to go. My Tigernu would fold up/squish down to practically nothing.

review):</p>\\n\\n<p>Here is the Long explanation of all the things I used it for and how it went:\\n<br />Airport (in general it was Great):\\n<br />- Fits the personal item specifications/limits and I had 0 people question that so that is great (I had the backpack as personal-item and small suitcase as my carry-on).\\n<br />- Using the strap to put it on the small suitcase was great it's easy to take on/off and what I found great is that the balance is great it will not make the suitcase lose balance and drop to the floor and that is great\\n<br />- Carry the backpack in the airport instead of using the strap to put it in the suitcase for me is a little to much since the backpack is a big backpack and I'm a big guy I keep hitting people when I like turn around\\n<br />- Using the side pocket for the cable that goes to my anker charger is great I will just love if it had space for my phone (Fold 4)</p>\\n\\n<p>Walking around in city with a lot of people (Great but for some time/load):\\n<br />- It's great it really dose feel litter than other backpacks that I have use before\\n<br />- I was surprised at the quality of the zippers they are great and I did not see any issues even when I force it a little when the backpack was fully load it in all places\\n<br />- Walking without load was super light but the great quality make it hard when there is a lot of people because it retained the big size even do is essentially empty.\\n<br />- Walking with medium load it's still great but after 2h+ the end of the strap (Neck part) it start to butter me a bit\\n<br />- Walking with full load it's good for about 1h but after that upper part starts to be uncomfortable, it's not unbearable but it's not great like I could bear it for about 2h before I need to take it off my back.\\n<br />- Again because of it's size I really need to be carful of my movements on tight streets or on museums to not hit anything hahaha\\n<br />- Again using the charger side pocket is great and in this case since I was using my phone for directions and Uber I love that I can easily put it on my pocket and take it out without stop charging it</p>\\n\\n<p>Walking on a big archeological site with a lot of heat and people (Better than expected):\\n<br />* For this I had medium load most of the time\\n<br />- Backpack airflow was excellent, I'm not a sweaty guy in general but I had bad experience with backpack here before and I have to mention that it was great under almost not sweat and non visible backs sweat was there\\n<br />- Again walking was great I use the chest strap for extra support and I love it easy to adjust on the fly and I use this to keep me going for like 3h without any complains so I guess it adds 1h before it hurts in the upper area.\\n<br

backpack I love it\\n<br />- Great airflow\\n<br />- Great Quality\\n<br />- Great Balance\\n<br />- Great size perfect for personal-item on flight (Sometimes size is an issue)\\n<br />- I just LOVE the carabiner zipper\\n<br />- I also love the battery charger pocket with the easy take out cable\\n<br />- Durable zippers</p>\\n\\n<p>Cons/Suggestions:\\n<br />- Size sometimes is an issue be carful to not hit anyone and if you do apologies (I did hit some people with it hehe)\\n<br />- I will love a smaller version, maybe take out the middle section, so with only the front, side and laptop section without the big just 1 zipper section\\n<br />- No place to put phone when charging on the size (This is not use always but I will like this)\\n<br />- When fully load it upper part

I sent in a quick message over it to the support team and we agreed on a swap. Before I could even ship back the old bag, they had sent my replacement out. I cannot thank the team enough over there(great job team!). I have no major complaints and hope you may enjoy the backpack.', 'verified_buyer': True, 'created_at': '2023-01-18T01:17:06.926Z', 'reviewer_name': 'Robert B.', 'reviewer_initial': 'R', 'cf_answers': [], 'reply_content': None, 'pictures_urls': [], 'video_external_ids': [], 'thumb_up': 0, 'thumb_down': 0, 'location_country': 'United States', 'location_country_code': 'US', 'location': '(Hattiesburg, US)', 'source': None, 'product_title': 'Backpack', 'encoded_product_id': 'WVvBRKZ1', 'encoded_shop_id': '7DLmvQay', 'is_shopify_lite': False, 'product_url': '/products/backpack', 'product_url_with_utm': 'https://www.lttstore.com/products/backpack?jdgm_referral_location=product&ref=judge.me&utm_campaign=judgeme-review-site&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=judgeme', 'product_in_store': True, 'profile_img_idx': 4, 'avatar_image_url': None, 'gravatar_hash': None, 'media_platform_hosted_video_infos': [], 'country_code_show_flag': 'US', 'pinned': None, 'in_a_group': False, 'shop_reply_name': 'lttstore.com', 'verified_purchase': True, 'reviewer_public_slug': None, 'reviewer_public_id': 'Dqpb28Ep', 'collected_source': 'invite', 'has_coupon': False}, {'uuid': '0a70ef27-497e-401a-af61-622ab81976f9', 'title': 'Well worth the money', 'rating': 5, 'body_html': \"<p>The bag is expensive and that's my only issue with it but if you can get past the price tag I guarantee you will find it worth it.

As someone who is six foot the back pack feels short on my back and when the straps are fitted.

Having it all hang off the shoulders like it does creates a leaver and pulls the centre of mass higher and backwards which is horrible for walking longer distances and forces the user to slouch forward to compensate.

Being able to attach things with carabiners, get specialized pouches/holsters, or even 3d printing custom solutions is great.

As for comfort padding on the straps is very nice and makes it pretty easy to wear a lot longer also the ventilation on the back is a nice addition that i find really worth it walking around for a while im finding myself sweating less and my back just being more warm than anything. My favorite thing about the bag is the organization i didn't realize how much of an impact it would have. The orange inside not only looks cool but it makes finding everything way easier also how the pockets are layed out its made organizing everything way easier and super convenient to grab what i need the only complaint i have is the air tag holder it is to small to fit samsung smart galaxy tag it does fit but it's so exposed that if anyone searches my bag they would find it pretty easily. And last thing the price very expensive being a Canadian it costs way more with the conversion from us to cad overall this cost over 500 for the bag and shipping i understand many would not pay even close to this much for a bag but if i can pay a little extra for something that will last and i will love I'll take that chance. Overall i love this bag definitely gonna keep it for as long as it lasts if you where interested in this bag couple of key points to consider. First your life comes first if you don't have the money please look at other options there are plenty of cheap options that will work.  if you have the money consider if this is something you'll have for the next 10 years or longer. Or only for a year or two. And last thing how much do you use your bag? If you don't use it nearly every day or constantly go on multiple day trips or hikes i don't see why you would benefit from spending this much. I don't carry as much as other people I've seen buy i use it enough and plan to have it for a long time that's how i could justify. I believe this bag is worth checking out but do your own research and consider your options this is by no means a perfect bag but its a dam good one 4 out 5 stars for me.</p>\", 'body': \"I'll be honest I didn't need a bag such as this it's kinda over kill for what I carry on a daily basis but that being said after having this for a couple months I couldn't go back to the cheap bags i usually use first of all the build quality is outstanding it feels like it would last a long time the two downsides is that the bag doesn't deform much but i do like how it holds it's shape and it also allows it to stand upright by itself the only quality complaint is the zippers build quality they zip and unzip very satisfyingly but where you can hook them together its to wobbly and I'm worried that it will snap off with to much force so i never almost never hook them together. As for comfort padding on the straps is very nice and makes it pretty easy to wear a lot longer also the ventilation on the back is a nice addition that i find really worth it walking around for a while im finding myself sweating less and my back just being more warm than anything. My favorite thing about the bag is the organization i didn't realize how much of an impact it would have. The orange inside not only looks cool but it makes finding everything way easier also how the pockets are layed out its made organizing everything way easier and super convenient to grab what i need the only complaint i have is the air tag holder it is to small to fit samsung smart galaxy tag it does fit but it's so exposed that if anyone searches my bag they would find it pretty easily. And last thing the price very expensive being a Canadian it costs way more with the conversion from us to cad overall this cost over 500 for the bag and shipping i understand many would not pay even close to this much for a bag but if i can pay a little extra for something that will last and i will love I'll take that chance. Overall i love this bag definitely gonna keep it for as long as it lasts if you where interested in this bag couple of key points to consider. First your life comes first if you don't have the money please look at other options there are plenty of cheap options that will work.  if you have the money consider if this is something you'll have for the next 10 years or longer. Or only for a year or two. And last thing how much do you use your bag? If you don't use it nearly every day or constantly go on multiple day trips or hikes i don't see why you would benefit from spending this much. I don't carry as much as other people I've seen buy i use it enough and plan to have it for a long time that's how i could justify.

All three are/were military style, camping bugout bags that have an abundance of pockets and pouches. That\\'s the style I like and the LTT backpack fit this style but in a form factor that was a bit bigger than my other bags on the outside, and somehow smaller on the inside. My biggest bag from Seibertron was a 30L bag with two main pockets and smaller front that had some expansion in the form of adjustable straps along the side. The LTT backpack is 35L on the outside, but only 25.5L on the inside. 10L of space are taken up for those extra features! </p>\\n\\n<p>I primarily use backpacks for weekend trips, hiking, transporting game consoles, or electronics that I don\\'t want to carry one by one, etc. The LTT backpack was supposed to be the answer to a lot of the issues I had with other bags: Not enough space inside the bag, no small pocket for sensitive items like glasses, and crucially, trust in the build quality. Having a shoulder strap give out midway through a hike is not fun. I\\'ve been a long time viewer of every channel LTT has spun up since before they even had a merch store. I feel like I was swept up in the hype of the whole situation and now feel some buyer\\'s remorse. $250 for a backpack plus $30 in shipping that I still had to wait two months for is crazy now that I am thinking about it properly.

If you have a laptop, that fits great in the Safe Sleeve. But if you have a separate external screen, it will barely fit in the next size of Safe Sleeve that\\'s designed to hold those kinds of items. If I didn\\'t have a cover to go on the outside of the external screen already, I would not feel remotely comfortable using that pocket. Even though the Safe Sleeves are padded, it puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the devices inside because of the space certain laptops take up. I tested this with two different styles of 15\" laptops and it will only fit one at a time. The safe sleeves are not designed for two large items.

I\\'ve found in using this bag for the last month, my time to pack and leave has increased to about 2 hours compared to ~45 minutes with another day bag. If the bag is too full, you will notice the Side Pocket Flap for \\'Cable Management\\' will not cover that pocket and will be left exposed to the elements.
